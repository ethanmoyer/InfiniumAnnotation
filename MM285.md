Column Description
- 1-3: chrm, beg, end of target, length 2 for CpG, length 1 for SNP and CpH. beg is 0-based and end is 1-based like in bed files.
- 4-5: tango address for M and U
- 6: target: CpG, the target reference allele
- 7: extension base
- 8: col: color channel, green or red
- 9: probe: ID
- 10: last: last base on 3'-end of the probe sequence, for Infinium-II CpG probe it will always be C
- 11-19: mapFlag, mapChrm, mapPos, mapQ, mapCigar, mapSeq, mapNM, mapAS, mapYD
- 20: lastB: last for B-allele for Infinium-I probes
- 21-29: mapFlag.B, mapChrm.B, mapPos.B, mapQ.B, mapCigar.B, mapSeq.B, mapNM.B, mapAS.B, mapYD.B
- 30: design category string

## Using SeSAMe for preprocessing Infinium Mouse Array

Please note that you need sesame (Bioconductor link: [stable release](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sesame.html), [development](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/sesame.html)) version 1.9+ (currently on development branch, which needs [R-4.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html)) for native mouse array support. You can simply call the openSesame pipeline

```R
library(sesame)
betas = openSesame("IDAT_folder")
```

More information can be found at the sesame [mouse array vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/sesame/inst/doc/mouse.html).

For previous versions, you need to supply the custom sesame order file for mouse array. Here is an example of using custom order file.

```R
library(sesame)
mft <- readRDS(url("https://zwdzwd.s3.amazonaws.com/InfiniumAnnotation/current/MM285/MM285.address.rds"))
ssets <- lapply(searchIDATprefixes('path_to_IDAT_folder'), readIDATpair, manifest=mft$ordering, controls=mft$controls, platform='MM285')
```

### Gene association (ToDo)

### Histone Modification (ToDo)

## Mouse Array ID system

The mouse array uses an improved ID system that is built on top of the conventional "cg" numbers that EPIC and HM450 human array uses. The new ID system uniquely specifies the design details. The new ID system is designed to accomodate more flexible probe design such as replicates and opposite-strand design. The following diagram illustrated the intended meaning of each field in the appended suffix.
